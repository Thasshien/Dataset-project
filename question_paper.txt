Question 1 [10 marks]
Question: Explain the concept of ACID properties in database transactions. Discuss how each property ensures data
consistency and provide real-world scenarios where violation of these properties could lead to problems.

Question 2 [8 marks]
Question: Write a SQL query to find the top 5 departments by average salary, excluding departments with fewer than
10 employees. Include department name and average salary in results.
Expected Answer:
SELECT d.dept_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM departments d
INNER JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_id, d.dept_name
HAVING COUNT(e.emp_id) >= 10
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
Key Points:
* Correct JOIN syntax connecting departments and employees tables
* GROUP BY clause with both dept_id and dept_name
* HAVING clause for filtering groups by employee count (COUNT >= 10)
* ORDER BY with DESC for descending average salary
* LIMIT 5 to restrict result set
* Correct aggregation function AVG()

Question 4 [7 marks]
Question: Given an array of integers, implement an algorithm to find if there exists a subarray with sum equal to a
target value. Time complexity should not exceed O(n).
Expected Answer Approach:
def find_subarray_sum(arr, target):
    seen_sums = {0} # Set to track cumulative sums
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        current_sum += num
        if (current_sum - target) in seen_sums:
            return True
        seen_sums.add(current_sum)
    return False
Key Points:
* Use of hash set/dictionary for O(1) lookup of cumulative sums
* Cumulative sum approach to track running total
* Logic: if (current_sum - target) exists, then subarray found
* Single pass through array = O(n) time complexity
* O(n) space complexity for set storage
* Handles negative numbers and edge cases
* Alternative: Sliding window for positive integers only
Question 5 [9 marks]

Question 6 [6 marks]
Question: Write a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to calculate the monthly revenue for each product category, sorting
by revenue in descending order.
Expected Answer:
db.orders.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
_id: {
                category: "$product.category",
                month: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m", date: "$order_date" } }
            },
            monthly_revenue: { $sum: "$total_amount" }
        }
    },
    {
        $sort: { monthly_revenue: -1 }
    }
])
Key Points:
* Correct $group stage with nested _id for category and month
* $dateToString for formatting date to YYYY-MM format
* $sum aggregation to calculate total revenue
* $sort stage with -1 for descending order
* Proper MongoDB syntax and nested field access ($product.category)
* Handles multiple documents per category-month combination
* Alternative: Using $month and $year functions instead of $dateToString
