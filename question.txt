['EXAM ANSWER KEY\nComputer Science - Advanced Topics\nDate: December 18, 2025\nQuestion 1 [10 marks]\nQuestion: Explain the concept of ACID properties in database transactions. Discuss how each property ensures data\nconsistency and provide real-world scenarios where violation of these properties could lead to problems.\nEvaluation Rubric:\nTrait\nWeight\nDescription\nConcept Coverage\n40%\nComprehensive explanation of all 4 ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation\nReal-World Application\n30%\nClear examples of transactions and scenarios where violations cause problems\nLogical Flow\n20%\nWell-organized answer with clear connections between properties\nClarity & Language\n10%\nClear writing, appropriate terminology usage\nQuestion 2 [8 marks]\nQuestion: Write a SQL query to find the top 5 departments by average salary, excluding departments with fewer than\n10 employees. Include department name and average salary in results.\nExpected Answer:\nSELECT d.dept_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary\nFROM departments d\nINNER JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id\nGROUP BY d.dept_id, d.dept_name\nHAVING COUNT(e.emp_id) >= 10\nORDER BY avg_salary DESC\nLIMIT 5;\nKey Points:\n• Correct JOIN syntax connecting departments and employees tables\n• GROUP BY clause with both dept_id and dept_name\n• HAVING clause for filtering groups by employee count (COUNT >= 10)\n• ORDER BY with DESC for descending average salary\n• LIMIT 5 to restrict result set\n• Correct aggregation function AVG()\nQuestion 3 [12 marks]\nQuestion: Discuss the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning. Provide at least two examples for\neach category and explain why certain problem types are better suited to each approach.\nEvaluation Rubric:\nTrait\nWeight\nDescription\nFundamental Differences\n35%\nClear explanation of labeled vs unlabeled data, training approach differences\nExamples Provided\n35%\nMinimum 2 valid examples each (supervised: classification, regression; unsupervised:',
 'Problem Suitability Analysis\n20%\nReasoning for why certain problems fit each approach\nOrganization & Clarity\n10%\nWell-structured response with clear delineation between sections\nQuestion 4 [7 marks]\nQuestion: Given an array of integers, implement an algorithm to find if there exists a subarray with sum equal to a\ntarget value. Time complexity should not exceed O(n).\nExpected Answer Approach:\ndef find_subarray_sum(arr, target):\n    seen_sums = {0} # Set to track cumulative sums\n    current_sum = 0\n    \n    for num in arr:\n        current_sum += num\n        if (current_sum - target) in seen_sums:\n            return True\n        seen_sums.add(current_sum)\n    return False\nKey Points:\n• Use of hash set/dictionary for O(1) lookup of cumulative sums\n• Cumulative sum approach to track running total\n• Logic: if (current_sum - target) exists, then subarray found\n• Single pass through array = O(n) time complexity\n• O(n) space complexity for set storage\n• Handles negative numbers and edge cases\n• Alternative: Sliding window for positive integers only\nQuestion 5 [9 marks]\nQuestion: Analyze the impact of network latency and bandwidth constraints on distributed system design. How would\nyou architect a system to handle high-latency and low-bandwidth environments?\nEvaluation Rubric:\nTrait\nWeight\nDescription\nImpact Analysis\n30%\nExplanation of latency/bandwidth effects on system performance and reliability\nDesign Strategies\n40%\nMultiple strategies (caching, compression, async communication, local processing, bat\nTrade-offs Discussion\n20%\nUnderstanding of consistency vs performance trade-offs\nCoherence & Examples\n10%\nWell-articulated with practical examples\nQuestion 6 [6 marks]\nQuestion: Write a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to calculate the monthly revenue for each product category, sorting\nby revenue in descending order.\nExpected Answer:\ndb.orders.aggregate([\n    {\n        $group: {',
 '_id: {\n                category: "$product.category",\n                month: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m", date: "$order_date" } }\n            },\n            monthly_revenue: { $sum: "$total_amount" }\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        $sort: { monthly_revenue: -1 }\n    }\n])\nKey Points:\n• Correct $group stage with nested _id for category and month\n• $dateToString for formatting date to YYYY-MM format\n• $sum aggregation to calculate total revenue\n• $sort stage with -1 for descending order\n• Proper MongoDB syntax and nested field access ($product.category)\n• Handles multiple documents per category-month combination\n• Alternative: Using $month and $year functions instead of $dateToString',
